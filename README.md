# SHEcure: Empowering Women's Health and Safety
SHEcure is a web application designed to support women's health and well-being through assistive technologies. Built with a React frontend and Firebase backend, it offers features like a period tracker, nearby pharmacy and hospital locator, doctor appointment scheduling, and a harassment report submission system. The platform serves three user roles:

* Normal Users: Access all health and safety features.
* Doctors: Manage appointment requests and communicate with patients.
* NGOs: Review harassment reports and assist those in need.

SHEcure aims to provide a holistic and secure solution for women's health and safety
